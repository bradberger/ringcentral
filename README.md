Go bindings for RingCentral API. Work in progress, but differs
from current Go bindings because it's:

- Is more intuitive Go
- Is unit tested
- Will have 100% code coverage
- Has defined types for responses and requests
- Will have better usage examples and documentation
- GoDoc support
- Google App Engine support out of the box
